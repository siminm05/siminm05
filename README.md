👋 Hi, I’m simin
I’m interested in: (currently) an internship
I’m currently learning C/C++
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: I’m open to teaming up on cool projects — especially anything with low-level coding, fun UI work, or student-led initiatives!
How to reach me: siminm1905@gmail.com or DM me here on GitHub
un fact: I like growing fruits and veggies in my garden when I’m not coding!
